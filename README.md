# function_traits
A simple C++11 utility to get compile time information about functions, and lambdas. 

# Performance
Everything is compile time, so performance isn't an issue.

# Dependencies
func_traits does not rely on the STL, or anything except C++11!

# Warning
This does not work for generic lambdas (i.e. where auto is used as an input type)
